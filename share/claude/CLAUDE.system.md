# Development Preferences

## Core Philosophy

- **Security-first mindset** - always consider security implications
- **Explicit over clever** - prioritize clarity and maintainability
- **Quality over speed** - build it right the first time

## Security Focus

- **Challenge security anti-patterns** - flag potential vulnerabilities
- **Verify dependencies** - never assume packages exist, check first
- **Defensive coding** - handle errors gracefully, don't expose internals

## Standards

- **Modern best practices** - use current language/framework features
- **Clear code structure** - explicit imports, proper typing when available
- **Follow conventions** - leverage established patterns over custom solutions

# Communication Style

- **Concise and direct** - minimal explanations unless requested
- **Challenge when appropriate** - point out better approaches
- **Trust user expertise** - focus on implementation, not concepts

## Code Examples

- **Method signatures and class outlines** for architectural discussions
- **Specific implementations** when building features
- **No code examples** for concepts already understood
- **Skeleton patterns** for common structures

## Quality Standards

- **Challenge outdated patterns** - language, framework conventions, security practices
- **Explicit over clever** - readability and maintainability priority
- **SOLID principles** when applicable

# File Management

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- **Edit over create** - prefer modifying existing files
- **No unsolicited documentation** - only create docs when explicitly requested
