#
# NAME
#   ical-week -- print the week number according to Calendar.app
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   ical-week [-n] [-N[COUNT] | -P[COUNT]] [YYYY-MM-DD]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Prints the week number according to Calendar.app, which differs from the
#   "%U", "%W", and "%V" formats of strftime(3).
#
# OPTIONS
#   -n, --no-pad
#     If set, no prepending 0 is used with single digit week numbers (i.e. Jan
#     1st will return "1" instead of "01").
#
#   -L[COUNT], --last[=COUNT]
#     If set, shows the previous week's number. Specify a COUNT to go back
#     further.
#
#   -N[COUNT], --next[=COUNT]
#     If set, shows the next week's number. Specify a COUNT to go forward
#     further.
#
#   --start-date
#     If set, shows the start date of the week.
#
#   --end-date
#     If set, shows the end date of the week.
#
# SEE ALSO
#   DATE(1), STRFTIME(3)

# Prints the Calendar.app week number
#
# $1 - date in %Y-%m-%d format
# $2 - pad string to use with printf (i.e. "" or "02")
#
# Note: I know what you're thinking... "Hey, look at this clown, calculating
# the week number by hand instead of reaching for `date` and '%U', '%W' or
# '%V'. He probably didn't even RTFM!" Well, you're right, I didn't really
# peruse `man date` much until I saw that Calendar.app's week number did not
# match those from strftime(3). I promise, I wanted this entire monstrosity to
# be a one-liner. But, alas, computers.
#
# Anyway, if you've read this far, gather 'round and let me tell you a tale of
# week numbers on macOS.
#
# Calendar.app does not use ISO 8601 unless a user changes their calendar
# setting in System Preferneces -> Language & Region to ISO 8601.
#
# As a result week numbers in Calendar.app do not match those obtained by
# programming languages that use strftime(3) (i.e. `%V` and `%U` in `date`
# or Ruby's `Time#strftime`):
#
#   - %U: is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day
#         of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).
#
#   - %V: is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day
#         of the week) as a decimal number (01-53). If the week containing
#         January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1;
#         otherwise it is the last week of the previous year, and the next
#         week is week 1.
#
#   - %W: is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day
#         of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).
#
# These options are not appropriate to obtain the week number used by
# Calendar.app. Instead, January 1 is Week 1 *always*, which consequently
# means Week 53 only occurs in Calendar.app if December 31 is a Sunday.
#
# The days that `date` considers start of week for its various week number
# options also complicate things.
#
#   - %U: is close to what we want. Its week starts on Sunday like we want,
#         but it uses Week 53 and Week 0. It is a good candidate for manually
#         calculating the week number if we can work around Weeks 53 and 0.
#   - %V: is really what macOS/Calendar.app should be using, but I don't want
#         to change my time preference to make it work right. It is a bad
#         candidate to use for our manual calculation as well since its week
#         starts on Monday.
#   - %W: is also close to what we want, like %U, but its week starts on a
#         Monday.
#
# With all that in mind, we reach for NSDate which does what we want.
