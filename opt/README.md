These are random CLI scripts I've written and organized by project or OS.

To use them, either add the directory to `PATH`:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.dotfiles/opt/macos-scripts/bin:$PATH"
```

Or symlink the scripts to a directory already in `PATH`:

```
sudo ln -s ~/.dotfiles/opt/macos-scripts/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```
