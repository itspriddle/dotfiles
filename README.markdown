# My dotfiles

My dotfiles, randomly collected over the years. I use this repo on OS X and
Linux, primarily for developing Ruby on Rails applications.

## Installation

I keep this repo in `~/.dotfiles` and symlink the files and directories
inside.

    git clone git://github.com/itspriddle/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    make install
