# Captain's Log, Supplemental

Okay, I totally stole the word "supplemental" from Captain Picard. Anyway,
this is a meta plugin that I use to store Vim config files that supplement my
core/plugin configuration.

It started out as a way to avoid keeping stuff in `~/.vim/after` and friends
and has since evolved into a prolonged experiment in modularized Vim
configuration.
